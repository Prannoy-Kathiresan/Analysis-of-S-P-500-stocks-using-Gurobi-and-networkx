# 📈 Network Analysis of S&P 500 Stocks using Gurobi and NetworkX

This project applies graph theory to stock market data to uncover structural relationships among companies in the S&P 500 index. Using correlation networks, we identify sector dominance, explore inter-company relationships, and visualize the market as a dynamic system.

## 🧾 Code

The full implementation can be found in the Jupyter Notebook:

## 🚀 Project Summary

- Analyzed daily log returns of S&P 500 companies from April 2020 onward to study stock behavior during and post-COVID
- Built correlation-based and distance-based networks to model inter-company relationships
- Applied **Maximum Clique** and **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** analysis
- Explored sector clustering and threshold-based network behavior (from -0.2 to 0.9)

---

## 🛠 Technologies & Libraries

- Python 3.8+
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- NetworkX (graph modeling)
- Gurobi (for Maximum Clique optimization)

---

## 🧪 Methods

### ✅ Data Processing
- Calculated daily **log returns** for stationarity
- Created a **Pearson correlation matrix**
- Converted correlations to distances: `d = √(2(1 - correlation))`

### 🔗 Correlation Networks
- Applied threshold values θ = -0.2 to 0.9 to build filtered graphs
- Extracted **Maximum Cliques** at each threshold to find tightly connected subgroups
- Color-coded nodes by sector

### 🌳 Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
- Constructed MST from the distance matrix
- Visualized structural relationships and sector clustering

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Financial Services** was the dominant sector at higher correlation thresholds
- MST visualizations revealed strong intra-sector ties
- Lower thresholds showed a broader spread of sectors (e.g., Real Estate, Energy, Financial Services, Communication Services)
